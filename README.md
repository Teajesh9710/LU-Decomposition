# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
```
Step 1:
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
Step 2: 
Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.
Step 4:
End the program.
```
## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
